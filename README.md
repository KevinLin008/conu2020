The objective of this project was to provide a music player that not only had basic music player functionalities (this project used Spotify's API), but also had a feature that introduced a social aspect. Our feature was to have a voting system where at the end of each song, listeners of a "room" could put up 5 songs and all the listeners of the "room" could vote on the song that they would like as the next song in the queue, song with the most votes gets played.
