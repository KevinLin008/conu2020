The objective of this project was to provide a music player that not only had basic music player functionalities (we used Spotify's API), but also had a feature that introduced a social aspect. Our feature was to have a polling system where at the end of the song, the player would select or listeners of a "room" could put up 5 songs and all the listeners of the "room" could vote on the song that they would like as the next in the queue, song with the most votes gets played.
